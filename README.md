### Task Manager App
1. Application and Functionality
This is a simple Task Manager application that allows users to:

Add tasks with a priority level (High, Medium, Low)
Edit and delete tasks
Search tasks by name
Mark tasks as completed, with a celebratory animation upon completion
Persist tasks in local storage so they are saved between sessions

2. Setup and Launch Process
To set up and run the application:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd task-manager
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the development server:
npm start
The app will launch in your browser.

3. Assumptions Made During Development
The app assumes that the user has a modern web browser that supports local storage and JavaScript.
The application does not currently include user authentication or task synchronization across multiple devices.
Tasks are stored locally in the browser's local storage and will persist until cleared by the user or their browser's storage is cleared.
